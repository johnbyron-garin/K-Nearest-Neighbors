## App Description: 
- The k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm that classifies new data based by finding its k nearest neighbors in the data set, and choosing the classification that is represented the most

## Dataset
- A dataset containing diabetes information will be used. The program's task is to classify the next points from diabetes.csv. The test file contains information regarding the number of pregnancies, glucose value, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin value, bmi, diabetes pedigree function, age, and outcome of a person. The person can be classified as either diabetic (outcome=1) or non-diabetic (outcome=0). The program must read input.in which contains unlabelled data points.
